# Procedural-Kaomoji-Shader-SDF

Add a little fun and personalities to the Prototyping Capsules.\
**An afternoon project, testing / improving as I play with it.** 

Not A Shader Guy. The Stop-Motion Animation Scribbly Eye probably doesn't belong in the same shader file due to branching. \
Oh well, remove it yourself.

Features:
- Fully Procedural and Customisable: L/R Eye & Mouth
- Add Presets or choose randomly
- C# or GDScript
